        <div>There are two good ways to visualize branches: on the command line <tt>git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate --abbrev-commit</tt> and using <tt>gitk -all</tt>. There are lots of variants to these commands; use <tt>gitk branch1 branch2</tt> to visual the two branches.</div>

        <div>When I first setup my work mac 10.7, I had some bash configuration options I wanted to set. The ~/.profile file existed, but no other bash startup files did. I read a little bit about the different files, didn't find any convincing arguments for me to care much, and put my configuration options in ~/.profile. Recently, I noticed that my tab completions and environment variables weren't getting set properly. I investigated a bit more today, and found the ~/.profile wasn't getting executed. I had a ~/.bash_login file! <a href="http://stefaanlippens.net/bashrc_and_others">Bashrc and others</a> taught me about the loading order. I had installed RVM recently, which created my ~/.bash_login file and caused my ~/.profile to be not executed.</div>

        <div>I have a file (.classpath) that git was tracking, but I didn&#8217;t want to see changes to with git status or commit them. The .gitignore file ignores untracked files, but not tracked ones. Some git index abuse allowed me to get what I wanted: <tt>git update-index --assume-unchanged &lt;file&gt;</tt>.</div>
