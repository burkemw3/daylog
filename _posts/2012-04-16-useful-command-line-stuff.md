Command line fu has a great list of [tips sorted by vote][]. Favorites that I don't know yet are:
* sudo !!: run last command as sudo
* python -m SimpleHTTPServer: serve current directory at http://localhost:8000/
* ^foo^bar: run previous command, but replace foo with bar
* ssh-copy-id user@host: copy SSH keys to a host
* &gt; file.txt: empty a file
* reset: salvage a borked terminal
* ssh user@host cat /path/to/remotefile | diff /path/to/localfile -: compare a local file to a remote file
* &#58;w !sudo tee %: use sudo permissions to save a file in vim
