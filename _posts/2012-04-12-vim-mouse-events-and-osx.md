There are occaisional times when I want to use the mouse in vim. I found [a post][] that helped me get going. I installed [SIMBL][] and [MouseTerm][]. Then I added <tt>set mouse=a</tt> to my .vimrc file.

There is one problem. When I select text in vim with the mouse, I cannot copy it to the clipboard with &#8984;+C. I am working on using <tt>*y</tt>, <tt>+y</tt>, or something else to get it working.
