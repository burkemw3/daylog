I use <tt>open</tt> from the command line to open files and folders as if I had double clicked on them in Finder. I open a Finder window in the current working directory <tt>open .</tt> the most.

On the flip side, I drag and drop folder from Finder on Terminal tabs to change the current working directory of the tab to what was dropped on it.
