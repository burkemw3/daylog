I have been using a Mighty Mouse for a few months, but they get so dirty.
They get dirty everywhere, and end up not working very well. So I switched
to a pretty standard Dell mouse.

I've been missing using the wheel for horizontal scrolling. Today, I found
out that holding the shift key and using the (usually vertical) scroll
wheel, I can scroll horizontally. Yay!
